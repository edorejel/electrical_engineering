# Red Light Therapy For Knee Pain and Ankle Pain

Red light therapy can be used to treat knee pain. This is especially useful, for prolonged standing in the construction site, when rennovating a new property.

The same red light therapy can be used to treat ankle pain.

However, both types of therapies can be used whenever you feel your knees and ankles need a treatment. See pictures below.

Usually, the red light therapy last for only 30 minutes, and this can help save you medical bills, and doctor visits.
