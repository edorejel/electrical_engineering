# Home Property Design Solution System

A simple system to explore different ways of rennovating a large property. First, the layout will be presented, in an easy to understand format. Then, other perspectives will be used, to build onto the entire layout, to see what is more advantageous to the property owner's fruition.

# Simple Design Plan - The First Component - A Parking System
- A simple design plan starts with how you want the tenants to park their cars, and where you will park your car.
- - There are several ways of achieving this, a few interesting ways of parking many cars on a small property are shown below, for example purposes:
 

  # Underground Invisible Car Parking for Many Cars on a Single Large Property
  - If you want to rennovate your large property, but include many newly built rental units, you can use an underground invisible car parking for extra parking.
  - - The parking system would be installed on the property, and the new tenants would be given access to the parking system by the property owner.

# Circular Rotating Car Parking System for "Very Safe" Exit into Busy Streets

- If you cannot see the car moving in the image below, please press play on the image, using your mouse or finger on your mobile device. The car should start to move.
