# Property Measuring Tools

- Tools to measure property to get accurate measurements.
- Measuring property is important because you must know the size of your property. Typically, you measure from the front-gate, or start of your driveway, all the way to the back, however, often times, you need to consider the front part of the
- - driveway that is outside of the gate, and is part of the city's sidewalk.
- If they block your driveway, then they interfere with your "obligation and duty" to enter into your own property, even though, the sidewalk is not in your property, but directly in front of your property. Thus, you can measure from the street, directly in front of your property,
- - all the way to the back, just in case you need to bring in construction equipment, or rennovate the property.
