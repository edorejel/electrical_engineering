In the event that prolonged standing is required, there are alternatives, to keep the lower back, legs, and feet healthy, and injury free. A good option is an "anti-fatigue mat."

# Ideal Usage
Put the anti-fatigue, stree-relief mat anywhere you like, or where you will stand for a very long time. Your lower back, knees, and feet will "tell you" something is wrong.
