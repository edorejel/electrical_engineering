# Car Turn Table Parking System

A simple, car turn-table parking system, to begin the first step, in thinking about rennovating your large size property. 

A preview of some pictures is shown below. The system is very easy to understand, it is simple in design, yet very effective and saves a lot of space. This way, you can build more on your property, instead of worry about driving more, on your property (think of it like this, **"I build more, instead of drive more"**). 

A property, typically, is to live in, and get in and out very easy, without worrying about parking or blocked driveways. The turn-table system is designed to blend into your property, so that it works in a hassle-free manner.
