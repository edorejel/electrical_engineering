# Helpful Device for Knees to Help Walking 

This device has springs on it, that may help ease the pain on your knees that can appear from walking or daily knee usage from very active adults.

__Small disclaimer:__ this device claims to help with join healing. This process may happen by reducing the load of the joints, thereby, letting the joints experience less pressure as you walk and stand. Logically, it makes sense. So, if you have knee pain, your shoes, or your feet, or your posture may be contributing to the knee pain. The knee is a very complex structure.
